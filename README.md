**Techiends** is a private club of "tech friends".

To join the club you have to 1) write up a one-page essay about yourself
and your strategic goals, 2) pass a one-hour interview with a
leading club member, 3) stay under his/her mentorship for six months,
and then 4) make a presentation about yourself and be accepted by the majority.

In order to stay in the club, each member pays $1024 every year.
The money goes to the joint fund (in Bitcoins).

Being a member of the club you have:

  * A mentor, helping you point your career to the direction
  * Tech friends, ready to help you out when needed
  * Money from the fund, if you have a good idea or need help
