**Techiends** is a private club of "tech friends".

To join the club you have to follow this process:

1. Write a one-page essay about yourself and your strategic goals
2. Pass a one-hour interview with a leading club member
3. Stay under his/her mentorship for six months
4. Make a presentation about yourself and be accepted by the majority.

In order to stay in the club, each member pays $1024 every year.
The money goes to the joint fund (in Bitcoins).

Being a member of the club you have:

* A mentor, helping you point your career to the right direction
* Tech friends, ready to help you out when needed
* Money from the fund, if you have a good idea or just need help

If the majority votes, a member can be excluded from the club.
